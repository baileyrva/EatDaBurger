# EatDaBurger
This repository ("EatDaBurger") is where I (Joe Bailey) developed a node.js application using JavaScript for the University of Richmond boot camp that I am currently enrolled in. The goal for this homework was to become more familiar with Node.js, express package, sequelize and databases in general by demonstrating the ability to create a working application that utilized databases and server setup. This application had the most indepth directions to date and required multiple different files working cohesively.


## Installation

The applicaiton is deployed using github and heroku. The files can be opened in browser. Afterwards, the user needs to run a npm install in order to install the dependencies. The user will identify a burger type and press the order button. Finally, the user will select to devour or destroy the individual burger. 

## User Story
**As a** restaurant manager\
**I want** to see the types of burgers my customers order\
**So that** I can develop a successful menu and restaurant. 

## Credits

I was the main creator of the main application and repository. For help when facing obstacles I leaned on my friend Blake, and my friend Chris. Blake is a programmer with 7+ years in the business, and Chris is a work friend who is a fantastic problem solver. I also used YouTube to find different videos on JavaScript, Node.js, express routes,and various troubleshooting tips.
